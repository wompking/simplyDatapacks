## Crafting Core
###### Datapack Author: wompking
This datapack adds a crafting structure used in some datapacks. The basic crafting structure is built like this, on the floor, with north upward:

![Basic Crafting Structure](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/680681632373407779/680682979546234887/structure.png)

The middle 9 blocks should be covered with item frames. Note that the structure will only activate **if both the item frames are present and the redstone lamp is lit**. Multiple crafting structures can be "joined" together in the east-west direction; no need to use extra birch wood. To use the crafting structure, put the required items in the item frames and light the redstone lamp; particles should appear and the item should craft.

Here's a template for custom crafting recipes:

## Mechanical Compactinator
###### Datapack Author: wompking
This datapack adds a way to create simple plates and alloys used in some datapacks. The Compactinator is built like this, standing upright:

![Compactinator](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/680681632373407779/680689259254120465/structurecompress.png)

To use the Compactinator, put the required materials under the piston and activate it; particles should appear and the item should craft. This new, crafted item will not despawn naturally. Note that multiple items cannot be crafted at once. *(I mean, they can, but not of the same type. For example: Item A is coal and emerald, Item B is emerald and diamond, Item C is diamond and iron. Two of any item cannot be crafted at the same time, one of Item A and B each cannot be crafted at the same time, and one of Item B and C each cannot be crafted at the same time. Only Item A and Item C can be crafted at the same time.)*

Here's a few Compactinator recipes, plus a template for making them:

## FAQ
***Q: Hey, I have a datapack idea / datapack that I would like to add to this list. How can I do this?***

A: For datapack ideas, just message me and I will see if I can make it. For datapacks, give me the datapack and I will modify it to be *Simply Certified Compatible* with the other datapacks.
