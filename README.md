# simplyDatapacks
A repository for all of the Simply Certified Compatible datapacks.

Note that these datapacks come seperately; you don't have to have all of them as long as all dependencies are resolved.

## Crafting Core
This datapack adds a crafting structure used in some datapacks. The basic crafting structure is built like this, on the floor, with north upward:

The middle 9 blocks should be covered with item frames. Note that the structure will only activate **if both the item frames are present and the redstone lamp is lit**. Multiple crafting structures can be "joined" together in the east-west direction; no need to use extra birch wood. To use the crafting structure, put the required items in the item frames and light the redstone lamp; particles should appear and the item should craft.

Here's a template for custom crafting recipes:

## Mechanical Compactinator
This datapack adds a way to create simple plates and alloys used in some datapacks. The Compactinator is built like this, standing upright:

To use the Compactinator, put the required materials under the piston and activate it; particles should appear and the item should craft. This new, crafted item will not despawn naturally. Note that multiple items cannot be crafted at once. *(I mean, they can, but not of the same type. For example: Item A is coal and emerald, Item B is emerald and diamond, Item C is diamond and iron. Two of any item cannot be crafted at the same time, one of Item A and B each cannot be crafted at the same time, and one of Item B and C each cannot be crafted at the same time. Only Item A and Item C can be crafted at the same time.)*

Here's a few Compactinator recipes, plus a template for making them:

Note that when firing close to straight down, the firer may be shot instead of the target.
